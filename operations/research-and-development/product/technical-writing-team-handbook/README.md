## Our goal

The training and education team is responsible for ensuring that information is available to help Mattermost customers adopt and see value from Mattermost products and services as quickly as possible.

## Our culture

- We empower customers and partners to succeed with product knowledge.
- We write clearly and in plain language to be understood globally.
- We develop content using a variety of learning approaches and mediums to meet our customers and partners where they are during their learning journey.
- We don't limit our actions to the immediate need. We leave things in better shape than we initially found it.
- We translate technical concepts and workflows into achievable bite-sized pieces.

## Areas of ownership

We develop and deliver the following educational and training assets:
- product documentation aligned with monthly product releases
- product training courses and lessons

We also provide information architecture and editorial support for Mattermost developer documentation, API reference documentation, GitHub repository READMEs, Support Knowledge Base articles, the Mattermost Handbook, and community and staff contributions to Mattermost information assets

In addition, we define the product voice through in-product microcopy and offer US English language support for product localization.

## What tools do we use?

See the [build tools](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/research-and-development/product/technical-writing-team-handbook/product-docs-build-tools) page for details on how we use Sphinx to build and maintain the product documentation, Hugo for the developer documentation, and GitHub and GitBook to maintain the Handbook.
