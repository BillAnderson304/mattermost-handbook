# How to contribute to Mattermost documentation

Mattermost product, developer, integrations, API, Handbook, and GitHub repository README documentation is open source and accessible via GitHub. Everyone is welcome to contribute to these sites and pages, including staff, customers, partners, and community members.

## Submit small corrections or changes

To submit small corrections or changes to individual pages:

1. Select the Edit on GitHub option in the top right corner of any documentation page.
2. Apply your changes in the GitHub editor.
3. Create a branch or a fork of that GitHub repository that contains your changes.
4. Create a pull request (PR) that includes your changes, and describe the changes proposed.

Your PR will be reviewed by Mattermost staff for technical accuracy and alignment with the documentation style guide.

## Submit a series of related changes

Please bundle multiple related changes together in a single branch or fork. The writing team can help you get started working with forks or branches.

## Submit larger changes or new content

The writing team can help you get started, identify where your changes should live, provide editorial support, and will help you publish your updates.

## Develop Mattermost Product Documentation

Mattermost Product Documentation is available at docs.mattermost.com. This site is generated using a Python-based tool called Sphinx.

Anyone can contribute to the Mattermost Product Documentation site in the form of GitHub pull requests (PRs).

The majority of documentation source files are written in ReStructuredText (RST) format, and the remainder are written in Markdown (MD) format. The writing team can help with RST and MD syntax questions and issues for this site.

Documentation contributors can use GitHub web tools to propose content updates, or they can do so using a local development environment. A local development environment is recommended when developing new content, or making changes to multiple files at a time. See the [Mattermost Product Documentation GitHub repo README file](https://github.com/mattermost/docs#readme) for details on setting one up.
