# How to log an issue

Find a typo, a mistake, or an issue in Mattermost documentation? [Log it as a documentation issue](https://github.com/mattermost/docs/issues/new) or let us know in the [Documentation Working Group channel](https://community.mattermost.com/core/channels/dwg-documentation-working-group).

Note the page URL, describe the issue in detail, and an optional screenshot. We'll review and take action, or help you to apply the change yourself.

Reach out any time and we'll help figure out next steps.
