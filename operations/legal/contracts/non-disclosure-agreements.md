# Non-Disclosure Agreements

Whenever possible, you should always be using the Mattermost template. A Counterparty may send you their NDA automatically, but as the Workflow Owner, you should push back, at least once but preferably twice, to use Mattermost’s template. If you must use the Counterparty’s paper, please see the section Requesting Review of a Third-Party Contract.

In Ironclad:

1. Click the green **+ Start workflow** button, select the **Mattermost MNDA** on the left, and click the green **Start Workflow** button.

2. Ironclad will open the Launch Form. The information you need to know to complete the Launch Form is:

    a. The department the DNA is for (Sales, Marketing, Product, Engineering, Legal, Human Resources, Finance, and Security).
    b. If you are submitting on behalf of someone else at Mattermost, their name and Mattermost email.

    d. The Counterparty’s address (including the suite or unit number if there is one).
    e. The purpose of your NDA.
        i. Is the purpose to discuss a potential business relationship? — If Yes, move on.
        ii. If not, is the purpose to work with a Consultant already providing services (who signed a consulting agreement with Mattermost), or to work with a Vendor’s consultant who does not have a direct contract with Mattermost? —If Yes, move on.
        iii. If not, you will need to provide:
            - The purpose of your NDA.
            - What Mattermost will be sharing with the Counterparty and what the Counterparty will be sharing with Mattermost.
    f. The name of the person signing for the Counterparty.

6. Once the Counterparty signs the agreement, Ironclad will pull that into Ironclad, archive the agreement, and notify legal that the NDA is complete. When you use Mattermost’s NDA template, Mattermost does not need to countersign the NDA.
