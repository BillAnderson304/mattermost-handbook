# Review Drafted Agreement in Ironclad and Make Edits

At any time after a workflow has been fully launched (all portions of the Launch Form have been completed, including Counterparty Forms, if applicable) you can review the drafted agreement.

Open the workflow page you want to look at.

What do you want to do?
* Read the drafted agreement
* Make a change to the information provided on the Launch Form
* Make redlines to the agreement for Legal

## Read the drafted agreement

1. Click the blue hyperlink that contains the name of the agreement to open the agreement.

5. Make sure that box next to **Change turn** is UNCHECKED and click the green **Update Information** button.

**Note**: Changing the information may cause some approvals to reset, based on the conditions of the workflow. For example, if the contract contains a discount, and Finance has already approved the discount originally listed, changing the discount will re-trigger Finance to review the discount.

## Make redlines to the agreement for Legal

1. Open the document by clicking the blue hyperlink or clicking on the **Pencil**.

3. Make sure the track changes are enabled so Legal can review your changes.

4. Begin typing your change.  

**Note**: If the change you want to make is to any information provided on the Launch Form, you need to use the **Edit Info** procedure described above. Also, by making changes here, you WILL trigger Legal to review (or re-review if already approved) your contact.

5. Once you have made your changes, click the green **Save as a New Version** button.

6. This will open a new window asking for a comment on the changes. Type your comment, make sure the box is UNCHECKED next to **Change turn to Mattermost**, and click the green **Save** button.
