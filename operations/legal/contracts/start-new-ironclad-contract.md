# Start a New Ironclad Contract

When you’re ready to start a new workflow (contract) all you have to do is select the correct choice from the dropdown list; NO MORE WAITING FOR LEGAL TO SEND YOU THE TEMPLATE!!!!

1. From the **Dashboard**, click the green **+ Start workflow** button.

4. Complete the launch form questions (details on some specific workflows can be found on the following pages).

5. Submit (or save) the Launch Form.

6. Ironclad will take the responses to the questions you provided, fill them into the contract template, and draft the agreement.

7. Depending on the specific settings for that workflow, any required reviews will be listed on the workflow page.

8. Once all the required approvals are collected, Ironclad will automatically send the agreement out for signature.

**Note**: If the agreement is on the Counterparty’s paper the signature tags are not on the agreement and must be manually placed; this can also sometimes happen during negotiations. In this case, you will see that the packet is missing tags, and asks the Signature Coordinator to place the tags. Directions on this can be found on the Placing Signature Tags in a Workflow section.

9. Once the agreement is fully executed, Ironclad will note the signatures and prepare the workflow for archive. If the workflow needs a manual archive, LegalOps will be notified.  Ironclad will also send the Counterparty a copy of the fully executed agreement for their records (via DocuSign).

10. Once the workflow is archived, a copy will be saved to the Ironclad repository. If the agreement has termination dates or renewal notices, Ironclad will send the Workflow Owner reminder emails.
