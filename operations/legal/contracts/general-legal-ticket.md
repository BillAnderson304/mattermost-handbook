# General Legal Ticket

You can use the General Legal Ticket to submit a question you have to Legal. This is not for submitting a contract for review. Legal will respond to your ticket via Ironclad with their response. Should Legal have questions about the request, they will ask you via Ironclad.

In Ironclad:

1. Click the green **+ Start workflow** button select the **General Legal Ticket** on the left, and click the green **Start Workflow** button.
