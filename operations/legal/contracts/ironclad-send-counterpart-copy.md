# Send a Copy to the Counterparty to Review Before Signature

Sometimes a counterparty will want to review the agreement before signing it, or possibly they want to make redlines to the agreement (note this should NOT be encouraged). Ironclad allows you to send a copy of the agreement to the counterparty from within the workflow so that any subsequent emails will be included in the workflow Activity Fee and history.

1. Open the workflow page you want to look at.



2. You want to look for the **Email Document** button. Based on the workflow settings, certain approvals may be needed before the **Email Document** button will appear for you. In this case, send the person listed as **Legal Approver** a message using the Activity Feed asking them to send the document, and make sure you include the email address of the person you need the document sent to.



3. A new window will appear (very similar to a new email window) asking for the email address to send to, a basic email message (you can customize), and the information that will be included (the draft agreement). Once it looks correct, click the **Email document** button.



4. Ironclad will send an email, you will be CC’ed on the email, and record the activity in the Activity Feed.


## Update/Add a New Version
Sometimes updates will be made outside of Ironclad (in the example above, Ironclad sent a copy to the Counterparty and they may send back redlines) or changes were made to a downloaded version. The following steps will walk you through adding the updated version to Ironclad.

### When a Counterparty responds to the Ironclad email with redlines

1. When the vendor replies to the email, Ironclad will send you an email with a link to open the workflow.


2. Ironclad also automatically adds a copy of the email to the workflow Activity Feed, along with any attachments.


3. Before you add the attachment(s) to the workflow, you should review the attachments to confirm they should be added (sometimes a Counterparty logo may be attached as well). Click the blue hyperlink listing the name of the attachment, and Ironclad will download a copy to your computer. Open and review the attachment to confirm it makes sense to add to the workflow.


4. When you're ready to add the document, click the green **Add to Workflow** button and a new window will appear.


5. Select the correct option to save as:
   a. Choose the top choice if this is a new version (the vendor added redlines).


   b. Choose **New document** if the vendor has included something else that should be part of the agreement (such as a DPA to add).


6. Click the green button **Replace document** if added a new version or the green button **Add new document**.



7. Ironclad will process the document and add it to the workflow

### When you need to update the version but it’s NOT from an email into Ironclad 

In cases when the Counterparty sent the redlines to you directly:

1. Open the workflow you want to update.


2. Click the **Updated Document** button.


3. A new window will open up with all the documents in the workflow.


4. Click **Upload New Version** of the document you want to update.


5. A new window will open for you to locate the new version on your computer.


6. Select the document and click **Open**.


7. Enter a note about the updated document and click **Submit**.


8. Ironclad will process the document, add it to the workflow, leave a note in the Activity Feed, and update the version number.
