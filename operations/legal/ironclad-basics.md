# Ironclad Basics

## What is Ironclad?

Ironclad is a new Contract Lifecycle Management platform that Legal has decided to use going forward.  Ironclad allows you, the end user, the power of starting a contract on your timeline* to suit your business needs.

* Legal review times will still apply, contracts written on Mattermost templates will require much less time to review than a contract written on the vendor’s paper.

Ironclad gives you access to all the Mattermost templates applicable to you in your current role, allows you to start the workflow without input from Legal, incorporates all internal reviews needed (as listed in the Approvals Matrix), and automatically routes for signature (based on the ) Signing Authority. 

It also allows you to share drafts with the vendor directly through the platform and incorporates any redlines back from your vendor as an updated version within the workflow.  Together this allows anyone in your department to step in and continue progress if you are out sick. Once the contract is signed, Ironclad will send a copy to the vendor automatically, store the contract in Ironclad’s central repository, as well as send a copy to your department’s Box folder (if applicable).
