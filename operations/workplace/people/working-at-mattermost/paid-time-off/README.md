# Paid Time Off

Mattermost is a high performance, fast-paced startup where staff are empowered to do the best work of their careers. We love what we do and we love doing it from anywhere, working remotely and often blending our work and personal lives.

In many ways, Mattermost can be "the Olympics" of our professional careers, with the opportunity to grow and achieve far beyond anywhere we've worked before.

At the same time, like star athletes, our growth and peak performance benefit greatly from the ability to interleave periods of exertion with periods of rest and reflection.

Paid Time Off \("[PTO](../../../../../company/about-mattermost/list-of-terms.md#pto-or-paid-time-off)"\) is a process to help ensure our staff develop a strong practice of **self-care** by effectively rotating their time around work, family, friends and all the things that matter most to them.

Note: If you are taking [Pregnancy](../leaves-of-absence/pregnancy-leave.md) or [Parental Leave](../leaves-of-absence/pregnancy-leave.md), please see [Leave Policies](../leaves-of-absence/).

## Communicating time off

### When you take time off \(full days only\) please do the following

1. Communicate your Planned Time Off (PTO) by booking time off in **Rippling > Time Off > Schedule Time Off**. You can also watch this [short video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AmDFbIHGsBTPKg-TTTVlO6gAxSuLDFv0/view?usp=drive_link) on how to book time off in Rippling. PTO covers any number of things - including vacations, stay-cations, moving days, bereavement, etc. When submitting vacation requests in Rippling, select "Planned Time Off". PTO is in addition to official public holidays in your region of residence. In some countries where there are statutory vacation requirements, public holidays are a supplementary entitlement.
2. Statutory public holidays for FT Staff in entity and EOR locations (Australia, Canada, Germany, Sweden, US, UK) are automatically listed in Rippling. 
*For all FT Staff outside of entity and EOR locations, if there are any statutory public holidays in your region of residence that are not listed in Rippling, please ensure to enter the day in **Rippling > Time Off > Public Holiday** to distinguish it from vacation time.* 
3. If time off is being taken for sickness, including physical and mental needs, please enter these days in **Rippling > Time Off > Sick**, to distinguish from other types of PTO. Follow the appropriate process according to the statutory requirements in your region of residence. If taking extended time off for medical leave or for other types of [leaves](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/workplace/people/working-at-mattermost/leaves-of-absence), reach out to HR: hr@mattermost.com.
4. PTO requests must be "approved" in Rippling to show up in the "Who's Out" calendar.
5. Managers are responsible for approving their their direct reports' time off requests in Rippling before they proceed on time off.

### Where to go to see who's out

* [Stand-up channel](https://community.mattermost.com/private-core/channels/stand-up)
* Rippling homepage via the the ‘feed’ menu on your dashboard. Here, you will find information regarding who is out of office and who has upcoming time off scheduled.
* [Rippling Who's Out Calendar](https://mattermost.bamboohr.com/calendar). You can create an [iCalendar Feed](http://app.rippling.com/api/feed/calendar/pto/company/are2zz48b0jkynqd/b91837056f386ea9355b4e71f456c24a381efea19840116f0779e81f053199e4/calendar.ics?company=658390ff2cae6bf84a79bcb5) to link the Who's Out Calendar to your GCalendar. To configure this, go to your Calendar > Add other calendars > Select from URL option > Paste the calendar link and you're done!

### Common time off questions

1. **Is there really no limit?** There is no limit to how much time off you can take when your work is meeting or exceeding expectations. We strongly recommend a minimum of 2 weeks per year.
2. **Is PTO monitored?** PTO is not monitored, but we encourage managers to ensure their direct reports are taking at least the recommended minimum of 2 weeks off per year (and/or the statutory minimum in their region of residence). Time off is reported in regions where there is a statutory requirement to do so.

## Holidays

Please take off holidays relevant to your culture, resident [country/region](../../../../../company/about-mattermost/list-of-terms.md#country-region), and preferences. When doing so, please follow the time off process in [Communicating Time Off](./#communicating-time-off).
